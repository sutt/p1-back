Looks like we've got the pipeline setup. nice work. but the coord transforms are off enough to give inaccurate results. We'll need to debug, and i can do that manually by checking the coords with my mouse on the web app vs the ones you have marked on the screenshot.

Develop a plan document to step through different iterations of solutions and debugging in order of most likely to help and easiest to check.
- also provide quick sanity checks like that the map center + canvas-coord from canvas init 
- and even supply plans to provide to frontend to build extra testing/debug processes, but keep difficult implementation for later in the debug process

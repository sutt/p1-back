Develop a route + in-memory data store to keep track of users currently using the application client-side.

Each user will have a username string they will post every heartbeat_poll_interval (~5 seconds, parameterize this in code) to the route as a heartbeat to say they 

In the in-memory datastore: 
- keep track of when the user was first added (created_at)
- update when that user last pinged the server on this route (modified_at)
- remove the user from the datastore if the you are currently accessing it the time since last modified_at > heartbeat_poll_interval + grace_period
    - grace_period should also be parameterized in code, and should start equal to heartbeat_poll_interval
- make this safe for use with multiple concurrent users within this async request framework.

- routes: /api/user_online
    - GET: return a list of users, sorted by create_at time
    - POST: data: userName (str)
        - should also return a list of users, sorted by create_at time (same as the GET)
        - this will allow the client to send and get info with one req-res instead of two
    - add return-types to the added routes so that the openapi can populate a response type
